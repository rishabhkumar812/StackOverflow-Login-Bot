# StackOverflow-Login-Bot

Want to earn badges like Fanatic and Enthusiast on StackOverFlow. You will need to login your stackoverflow account daily for 30 days (Enthusiast badge)
and 100 days (Fanatic badge). Why do a repetitive task yourself? Let python bot handle it.

This repository includes a python file which can login StackOverflow automatically. It is achieved using [Selenium framework](https://www.selenium.dev/) and [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/).

Download your suitable version of ChromeDriver [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and extract chromedriver.exe.

Install Selenium using 'pip install selenium'

You are all set then. Run [StackOverflowloginBot.py](https://github.com/rishabhkumar812/StackOverflow-Login-Bot/blob/main/StackOverflowloginBot.py) and let python do the rest.
